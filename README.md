Just a basic website using the basics of HTML like **Lists (Ordered & Unordered), Links, Images** etc.

The home page has an ***H1 Heading*** and *links to three recipies web pages*. All the recipes web pages have H1 Heading at the top (Name of the recipe) folowed by an *image, short description, ingredients and steps.* Ingredients are presented in *unordered* list while the Steps are presented in *ordered list*. ***Nested lists*** are also used with *paragraph (<p>)* and *strong(<strong>)* html elements.
