    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aloo pakora are soft melt-in-the-mouth fried potato fritters coated in a delicious, golden, crispy batter. Aloo pakora is a popular street food snack served not only in Mumbai but in other parts of India as well.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 potato – medium to large sized</li>
        <li>1 cup gram flour (besan or chickpea flour)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Garam Masala Powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>⅔ to ¾ cup water</li>
        <li>2 to 3 pinches baking soda – optional</li>
        <li>½ to 1 teaspoon chaat masala powder for sprinkling on the pakora</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>oil as needed for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Make Batter</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 1 cup gram flour (besan), 2 tablespoon rice flour, ½ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain), ¼ teaspoon red chili powder, ¼ teaspoon garam masala powder, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing), 2 to 3 pinches of baking soda (optional) and salt as required to a bowl.
            <p>Baking soda helps to give a fluffy texture to the batter and the pakoras puff up while frying. You can consider to skip baking soda or use ¼ teaspoon baking powder.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Add ⅔ to ¾ cup of water and mix. You should get a medium smooth consistency. Add water in parts, and mix to get the right consistency. The batter should not be very thick. You can choose to have a medium-thick or medium consistency.
            <p>The amount of water needed will depend on the texture and quality of your besan. Finely ground gram flour will need less water and a coarsely ground besan will need more water.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Slice Potato</h4>
    <ol start="3">
        <li>Slice 1 medium to large potato thinly with a knife and set aside. Avoid using a mandolin slicer as the potato slices will be too thin.
            <p>Using thin potato slices will cause the pakoras to crisp up while frying and you want the potatoes to be soft and tender when cooked.</p>
            <p>Also do not make cut the slices thick as this would make up for undercooked potato after being fried.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Batter Coat Potato Slices</h4>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>Heat oil in a kadai and dip the slice in the batter. Make sure the whole potato slice is covered in batter.
            <p>Note that before you begin to batter coat the potatoes, heat oil in a kadai (wok) or a pan on medium to medium-high heat. Let the oil become hot.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Deep Fry</h4>
    <ol start="5">
        <li>Gently place the batter coated potato slice in hot oil. The oil should not be too hot or cool. Hold the bowl in your left hand and with your right hand, coat the potatoes with the batter. Gently drip off any extra batter in the bowl. Lift the batter coated potato slice and carefully place it in the hot oil.
            <p>Add 5 to 6 or more potato slices in the pan depending on your pan size. Do not overcrowd the pan with a lot of fritters as this would reduce the temperature of oil and will also make up for less crispy pakora.</p>
            <p><strong>Checking hotness of oil: </strong>Before adding the aloo pakora, add a few drops of the batter from a spoon in the oil. If it comes up too quickly the oil is very hot. It should come up fast yet steadily. If it does not come up or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>When one side is light golden or golden, turn over the pakora with a slotted spoon. Allow the second side to be fried until golden. Turn over a couple of times as needed for even cooking. Fry all the aloo pakora like this until they are golden and crisp on both sides.</li>
        <li>Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Serve aloo pakora hot or warm.</li>
    </ol>
